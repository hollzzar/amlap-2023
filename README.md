Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing (AMLaP) 29 conference, Donostia–San Sebastián, Spain, August 31 to September 2, 2023

Poster session III: Poster 13

The present study investigates cross-language activation in a unique language pair and experimental setting.
Palenquero is an Afro-Hispanic creole language comprising Caribbean Spanish and Central African Bantu features, with its lexicon largely derived from the Spanish superstrate.
Sixty Spanish-Palenquero bilinguals completed two sets of in-person experiments at the home of a community leader in San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia, to understand the dynamics of cross-language interaction in two highly similar languages.
Here we present results from 34 participants on an auditory dual-language lexical decision task in both Spanish and Palenquero.
“Yes” responses were real words in the target language, while “no” responses were divided into two types: pseudowords in the target language and distractors in the non-target language.
Higher accuracy on Spanish real words than on Spanish pseudowords and Palenquero distractors reflected a strong lexicality effect in the Spanish task that was attenuated in the Palenquero task.
Comparing the two “no” response types revealed a high degree of cross-language interference from Spanish in the Palenquero task, with higher accuracy and slower reaction times on Spanish distractors than on Palenquero pseudowords.
These results align with previous laboratory-based research showing differential patterns of cross-language activation according to relative language dominance.
