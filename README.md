## Updated abstract

The present study investigates cross-language activation in a unique language pair and experimental setting.
Palenquero is an Afro-Hispanic creole language comprising Caribbean Spanish and Central African Bantu features, with its lexicon largely derived from the Spanish superstrate.
Fifty nine Spanish-Palenquero bilinguals completed two sets of in-person experiments at the home of a community leader in San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia, to understand the dynamics of cross-language interaction in two highly similar languages.
Here we present results from 38 participants on an auditory dual-language lexical decision task in both Spanish and Palenquero.
“Yes” responses were real words in the target language, while “no” responses were divided into two types: pseudowords in the target language and distractors in the non-target language.
Faster reaction times on "yes" than on "no" responses in both tasks reflected robust lexicality effects, which were strongest in the Spanish task where "yes" responses were more accurate than "no" responses.
Comparing the two “no” response types revealed a high degree of cross-language activation between Spanish and Palenquero, with faster reaction times on distractors than on pseudowords.
These results align with previous laboratory-based research showing differential patterns of cross-language activation according to relative language dominance.
